  <summary> Social Media Influener Analysis</summary>
  
  <br/>
  
  **Description**: Using the top social media influencer data of 2021 for Youtube, Instagram, and TikTok platforms, we find a correlation between different types of influencer genres to their subscribers or views. We found that different genres, like sports channels, received more views/subscribers, and comments, while other genres are the opposite. 
  
  **Language**: Python <br/>
  **Code Management**: GitHub, Jupyter Notebook <br/>
  **Link**: This [folder](https://github.com/Mamesa-El/Projects/tree/main/Social%20Median%20Influencer) contains the final reports, jupyter notebook, and csv files.

  <summary> Acme Gourmet Meal Analysis </summary>
  
  <br/>
  
  **Description**: Utilize PostgreSQL database to store ACME customers' data and python to evaluate the best predictor of sales (location, holidays, menus). I determined that the weekend of a holiday resulted in actual sales being 31% below the expected sales.
  
  **Language**: Python, SQL <br/>
  **Code Management**: GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, PostreSQL <br/>
  **Link**: This [folder](https://github.com/Mamesa-El/Projects/tree/main/SQL_Acme%20Gourmet%20Meals) contains two separte folders. The first folder is the data analysis and the second folder is the data validation.
